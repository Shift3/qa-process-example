# QA Process Example
This project represents an example of our QA Process at Shift3. Review the Issues, Project Board, Milestone, and Labels to understand how they interact in a QA Sprint.

## Process
The process is defined in our Standards and Practices repo here: https://github.com/Shift3/standards-and-practices/blob/main/standards/qa-process.md
